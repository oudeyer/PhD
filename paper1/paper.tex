\section{Introduction}

	
	The study of the control of manipulation actions in humans has revealed a modular representation of actions 
	either in the cerebral cortex and in the spinal 
	cord with compositionality: an infinite number of movements can be expressed through combination of simple primitives, 
	and generalization: certain neurons (higher 
	in the hierarchy) can represent actions independently of the effectors used \cite{cangelosi2010integration}.
	
	The same idea holds for language expressiveness which is based on syntactic hierarchical combinations 
	on a vocabulary, that open infinite semantic possibilities. 
	Greenfield has also argued that this parallel between manipulation and language compositionality can be found in the human ontegenic development
	with combinatorial steps for manipulation and syntax acquired approximately at the same period and in the same order \cite{green}. 
	Also, the author explains that the development of the neural substrates for language and tool use could be an ontogenic homology as first of all
	the same neural computations for hierarchical combinations and their semantics should take place for both modalities, and furthermore 
	experiments with Broca's and Wernicke's aphasics show that hierarchical organization for language and manipulation is linked. 
	Broca's aphasics, who have less syntactic organization of speech were shown to also have problems of representation of the hierarchical organization
	of constructions with blocks, whereas Wernicke's aphasics, whose syntax is normal but speech semantics is impaired, succeed in representing such objects 
	hierarchies. 
	
	Functional MRI experiments by Higuchi et al. have shown that the human's neural substrates for tool use and language is indeed shared in 
	the dorsal BA44 Broca's area \cite{higuchi}, which gives evidence for the similar neural computations used. 
	They furthermore argue that these results supports the hypothesis that tool use have appeared first in primate evolution in F5 area,
	and then the language has developed in humans reusing part of tool use and manipulation neural substrates in human's Broca area, homolog of primate's F5.

	Like a developing child, a developmental robot will have to incrementally explore skills that add up to the hierarchy of previously learned skills 
	throughout its life, with a constraint being the cost and time of experimentation. 
	We will seek to define curiosity-driven hierarchical learning architectures 
	that could reuse the sensorimotor contingencies previously learned and to combine them 
	to explore more efficiently new complex sensorimotor models. 
		
	\subsection{Goal of the study}
			
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Exploring in a structured hierarchy is more efficient than directly from $M$ to $S$.
			\item Which task should I explore now ?
			\item How to choose between different means to explore a given space ? 
			\item How can high-level tasks guide the exploration of lower-level ones ?
			\item How can the system cope with perturbations on some of the forward models ?		
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Related work}
		\cite{ugur2014, ugur2015}.

		Different computational models have the possibility to learn skill hierarchies. 
		In finite environments represented by a factored Markov Decision Process \cite{vig}, an intrinsic motivation towards actions 
		maximizing Dynamic Bayesian Networks' structure has been shown to allow the learning of the environment's structure.
		
		In continuous environments but with discrete actions, Metzen et al. \cite{metzen2013} use the framework of options \cite{sutton1999between} 
		to learn skill hierarchies. 
		An intrinsic motivation rewards positively the novelty of the states encountered and negatively the prediction error of the learned skill model.
		
		The model from Fabisch et al. \cite{fabisch2014active} learns in a setting with a discrete task space (called contexts).
		It uses an intrinsic motivation for learning progress, and a Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm (D-UCB) to choose on which context the agent should train for.
		The Upper Confidence Bound algorithm chooses between contexts given their estimated learning progress and the uncertainty of these estimations
		by picking the context with the maximum upper confidence bound.
		In other words, it maximizes the expected reward plus something related to the uncertainty associated with it, selecting either contexts with 
		certain high rewards or ones with uncertain poor reward.
		This algorithm embeds directly a solution the exploration-exploitation trade-off problem as it represents the exploitation 
		of knowledge by the expected progress and the exploration of other solutions by the uncertainty bonus. 
		This algorithm supposes a stationary learning progress on each context so the authors use an adaptation 
		(D-UCB, \cite{kocsis2006discounted}) to encompass non-stationary learning progress.
		% Sliding Window UCB: \cite{garivier2011upper}
		
		In a fully continuous setting, Mugan et al. \cite{mugan} have developed an algorithm that first learns a qualitative representation of environment states
		and actions in order to then learn the structure of Dynamic Bayesian Networks representing the temporal contingencies of those states and actions.
		In order to choose which action to practice, the authors use the IAC \cite{oudeyer_intrinsic_2007} where the agent 
		is intrinsically motivated to choose actions that are estimated to yield high prediction error progress.
		
		Here, we will rely more specifically on the SAGG-RIAC architecture \cite{baranes_active_2013}.
		This architecture learns a single mapping between continuous motor and sensori (or task) 
		spaces with a competence-based intrinsic motivation. 
		In our hierarchy of sensorimotor models, each model will be explored using the SAGG-RIAC procedure, but it could be replaced by another one 
		without changing the mechanisms to learn the hierarchy that will be assessed.

\section{General Discussion}

%


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
